# RPS Multiplayer

### Things that are done
- User is able to join and type in their name
- User is able to select a RPS
- Winner will be shown in chat window
- What each user picked will be shown in the chat window
- Users are able to chat with each other
- Shows the score for each player

### Things That need improvement
- Sometimes when a user exists the game by closing the tab it doesnt remove them from the game. Looking into that bug still. 

### Things I would like to add in the future
- In the middle of the 2 players I would like it to fade in who won, then fade out.
- The chat I would like to have colored by system, player1, player2
- Ding when a new player arrives, another sound when a player leaves.
- Better UI/UX

### Final Thoughts.
This project was defiently hard, and I enjoyed the challenge. I got all the points that they have setup in the homework, but this game still does have some bugs like the one above mentioned. If had more time I could fix the bugs and polish the game a bit more.
